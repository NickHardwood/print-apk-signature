### [print-apk-signature](https://github.com/warren-bank/print-apk-signature)

#### Summary:

Command-line shell script to print the signature of a _JAR-signed_ Android APK (Application Package Kit) file.

#### Usage:

```bash
print-apk-signature "/path/to/file.apk"
```

* prints a lot of information about the signature
* this information includes (amongst other things):
  * [fingerprints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_fingerprint) of the public key, as generated by the following cryptographic hash algorithms:
    * MD5
    * SHA1
    * SHA256

```bash
print-apk-signature "/path/to/file.apk" <fingerprint_hash_algorithm>
```

* prints only the fingerprint of the public key, as generated by the specified cryptographic hash algorithm
  * `<fingerprint_hash_algorithm>` must match one of the following values:
    * MD5
    * SHA1
    * SHA256

```bash
compare-apk-signatures "/path/to/file_1.apk" "/path/to/file_2.apk"
```

* determines the `SHA1` fingerprint for each of the two input APK files
* compares these two fingerprint values
* prints either:
  * EQUAL
  * NOT EQUAL

#### Dependencies:

* always required:
  * [keytool](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/unix/keytool.html)

* only required by the Windows shell script:
  * [7z](https://portableapps.com/apps/utilities/7-zip_portable)

* only required by the Bash shell script:
  * [unzip](https://linux.die.net/man/1/unzip)

  * notes:
    * deprecates _JAR-signed APK Verification Scheme v1_
    * introduced in Android 7.0 (Nougat, API level 24)
    * an APK can be signed by both v1 and v2 signatures at the same time, so it remains backwards compatible with previous Android releases
  * implications:
    * an APK that is built having a `minSdkVersion` >= 24 can opt to exclude _JAR-signed APK Verification Scheme v1_
  * relevance:
    * _JAR-signed APK Verification Scheme v1_ is required by `print-apk-signature`
